# Pathfinding Visualizer

This project demonstrates pathfinding algorithms (Dijkstra's and A*) visually on a grid.

## Overview

Pathfinding Visualizer allows you to interactively set obstacles, start points, and end points on a grid canvas. It visualizes the process of finding the shortest path from the start point to the end point using two popular algorithms: Dijkstra's algorithm and A* search algorithm.

## Features

- **Interactive Grid:** Click to place start points, end points, and obstacles.
- **Visualization:** Watch as the algorithm explores and finds the shortest path.
- **Reset Functionality:** Clear the grid and start over.

## Usage

1. **Setting Up:**
   - Clone the repository.
   - Open `index.html` in your web browser.

2. **Interacting with the Grid:**
   - Click on the grid to place the start point, end point, and obstacles.
   - Choose an algorithm (Dijkstra or A*) and click "Start Algorithm".
   - Click "Reset Grid" to clear the grid and start over.

3. **Watching the Visualization:**
   - Observe how the algorithm explores the grid, marking open and closed nodes.
   - Once the path is found, it will be highlighted in blue.
